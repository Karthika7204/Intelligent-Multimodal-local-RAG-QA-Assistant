# Intelligent Multimodal Local RAG – QA Assistant

A **local Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that enables **Question Answering over PDFs, Images, and Audio files** using a Streamlit-based UI. This project runs fully **offline/local**, leveraging vector search (FAISS) and LLM-based reasoning to provide context-aware answers from user-uploaded documents.

## Project Webpages

## 🚀 Features

* 📄 **PDF Question Answering** – Ask questions from resumes, policies, reports, and other documents
* 🖼️ **Image-based Q&A** – Extract and reason over text content from images
* 🔊 **Audio-based Q&A** – Ask questions from uploaded audio files (speech-to-text supported)
* 🧠 **Multimodal RAG Pipeline** – Combines retrieval + generation for accurate responses
* 🔍 **FAISS Vector Index** – Efficient similarity search over embedded content
* 🧩 **Local Execution** – No cloud dependency; runs entirely on your machine
* 🌐 **Streamlit UI** – Clean and interactive web interface

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Intelligent-Multimodal-local-RAG-QA-Assistant.git
cd Intelligent-Multimodal-local-RAG-QA-Assistant
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run sapp.py
```

The app will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

## 🧪 Example Use Case

* Upload **MyResume.pdf** and **policy.pdf**
* Ask: *"Who is the candidate in the resume and are they eligible for the policy?"*
* The system:

  * Extracts content from both documents
  * Retrieves relevant sections
  * Provides a grounded, context-aware answer

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

* All files are processed **locally**
* No document data is stored externally
* Ideal for **sensitive documents** such as resumes, medical policies, and internal reports

---

## 📌 Limitations

* Eligibility or medical fitness cannot be inferred unless explicitly stated in documents
* OCR accuracy depends on image quality
* Audio clarity impacts transcription quality

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

* ✅ Support for video-based Q&A
* ✅ Advanced document-level citations
* ✅ Multi-language support
* ✅ UI-based index management
* ✅ Integration with fully local LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)
